# Classic-Snake-Game

The classic Snake game is a simple yet addictive game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, collecting food and growing longer with each piece of food it eats. The objective is to grow the snake as long as possible without colliding with the walls or itself.

## Gameplay

- **Controls:**
  - Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the direction of the snake.
  
- **Objective:**
  - Guide the snake to eat the food that appears randomly on the screen. Each piece of food eaten increases the length of the snake.
  - Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body, as this will end the game.

## Features

- Smooth and responsive controls using the keyboard arrow keys.
- Randomly placed food items for the snake to eat.
- Increasing difficulty as the snake grows longer.
- Score tracking to keep track of the player's progress.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into multiple files, each handling a specific aspect of the game:

- `main.py`: The main game loop and initialization.
- `snakeclass.py`: Handles the snake's movement and growth.
- `food.py`: Manages the placement and generation of food.
- `scoreboard.py`: Manages the scoring system and displays the score.
   Then finally i have imported food, scoreboard,snake in the main.py and used them there to complete my game.

## prog Language etc used:
- Python programming language
- Turtle module and time module
